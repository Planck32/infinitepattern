## IoT and Social Media

## IoT and Social Media Effects Over Time
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to everyday items that are connected to the internet. Over time, these have evolved to include remote sensors, medical devices, home security systems, and several other smart applications for commercial, industrial, and personal use. Many devices do not require a primary server to interact but can communicate directly with other devices. The most significant development with IoT devices is the rapid amount of growth in the number of devices connected to the internet and the continued expansion of the types of applications IoT devices address. Since its advent in the 1980s IoT devices have grown from use in a few vending machines and ATMs to an estimated 18 billion devices this year (Collela, 2017). Cybersecurity for IoT, therefore, is becoming essential in providing security for networked resources, including data and physical assets. Today, good IoT security includes end-to-end encryption, regularly patching operating systems and software running on devices, and physically securing items to discourage theft.
Social media platforms also have responded to new threats over time. New cybersecurity techniques have emerged to address new techniques used by hackers. Early social media platforms such as Friendster and Myspace ran on unencrypted protocols that made them vulnerable to data interception and IP address redirection. Today, social media platforms use encrypted endpoints and multi-factor-authentication to improve security. They also are embracing cybersecurity principles such as zero-trust and using machine learning to navigate and identify threats within the vast amounts of data they process daily. 


## Ethical Purposes

Many ethical concerns exist around the use of social media and IoT information. Many social media platforms have privacy agreements that allow customer data to be sold to advertising companies that can then target people more specifically based on a consumer profile built from usage information such as what they like or dislike, who their friends are, and what interests they follow. Some information may include location data that could build behavioral patterns and reveal businesses or other locations visited. For example, if someone frequents McDonalds, perhaps Taco Bell would like to get their attention.
But is using data gathered this way unethical? Some would say no. Users permit this type of data sharing by agreeing to a privacy statement they probably did not read when creating an account on the social media platform. Others disagree and say that this level of information sharing compromises confidentiality, regardless of what misinformed users agree to when signing up. Other ethical issues include government monitoring without permission. While government surveillance extends beyond social media and IoT devices, the Brennan Center for Justice notes that “[a] growing and unregulated trend of online surveillance raises concerns for civil rights and liberties” (Leninson-Waldman et al., 2022). This report goes on to say that government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation can monitor social media information without opening a formal assessment or investigation. While this may have some benefit in detecting threatening activity, such as terrorist attacks or other national threats, it raises ethical concerns whether these agencies could use this information to target otherwise law-abiding citizens. 



## Security
Balancing cost and security is a question of the risk tolerance identified by the organization and the consequences of a successful attack. If built-in security would cost three times more, then the cost of a breach must be less than this expense. Cost needs to consider not just financial expenses, but also reputational damage. The Christian worldview considers not just the reputation and financial damage to the organization, but also of the people who could be harmed by a data breach. It is important to consider whether a data breach could cause financial, physical, emotional, or other harm to individuals who had their information exposed. 


## Risks
While most sites provide a privacy policy and are often required by law to get user acceptance of the policy prior to collecting any information, informing users of risk is not as often done, nor is it necessarily legally required. Some types of businesses, such as the financial or investment industries, are required to inform customers of risk, which is usually about the danger of financial loss, but can include privacy vulnerabilities in the agreement of terms and conditions (Komnenic, 2022).
Social media sites are not required to inform users of risk prior to posting any personal information. Current data privacy and collection notifications require that the site explains the type of information collected, how the data is used, third party use, how users can control their own data and how they may be tracked. I believe the best thing to do here is to continue sharing about the risks involved with sharing personal information and distributing news about social media and other organizations that experience data breaches.
	 
##Privacy Laws and Legal Basis
One of the strongest sets of privacy laws is in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While this applies specifically to European Union citizens, it has a global reach to enforce and allow user control over their own data. While not specific to social media sites, it includes any site that collects personal information and allows people to verify the accuracy of information stored and request that all their personal information is deleted. The GDPR laws also require that consent is obtained prior to collecting any information.
Other laws that aim to protect user’s privacy and reduce risk include the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act enforced by the Federal Trade Commission which requires parental consent prior to collecting personal data from kids under the age of thirteen, including data submitted to social media platforms. State laws such as California’s Online Privacy Protection Act enhance the GDPR by adding local regulations that protect personal information and help reduce risk to individuals. 

 
## Analysis of the Ethical Implications of Cybersecurity Policies and Regulations
The group of national, international, and local cybersecurity policies and regulations provide a good framework for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of personal information shared and collected by IoT devices and social media sites. Ethically, it is important to build trust by implementing honest privacy policies that include expectations for data sharing and restricting personal data access to only those that the user has approved. Breaking trust in any area covered by the CIA triad will tarnish the integrity of the organization and diminish ethical reliability in the future. 
By adhering to trusted cybersecurity policies, IoT data and social media platforms have an opportunity to build trust in their services and become known as ethical managers of the personal information entrusted to them
